# Deploy-Prometheus-and-Grafana-on-Kubernetes-Cluster-using-Terraform-Helm

Objective:We are using Minikube to set up a local Kubernetes cluster for this project, allowing us to deploy and manage Kubernetes resources using Terraform without relying on a cloud provider.
Set up monitoring and visualization tools — Prometheus and Grafana — on a 
Kubernetes cluster using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools: Terraform and Helm. 
This project strengthens skills in cloud provisioning, cluster monitoring, Helm charts, 
and IaC automation.
